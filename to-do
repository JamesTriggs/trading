need to work on consuming ftse 100 data now that it's in csv format

the plot class needs splitting into classes so that it's callable from somewhere else

web wise - ready to be hooked to real data once that is dones

fixing the ftse100 price grabber:
from pandas_datareader.quandl import QuandlReader 

data = QuandlReader("WIKI/{}".fromat(ticker), start=START, end=END) 
df = data.read()
